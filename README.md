- 👋 Hi, I’m Sathishkumar S, and I’m from Chennai.

- 🌱 I’m currently learning Appeon PowerBuilder and SQL
- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate with PowerBuilder developers.

- 😄 Pronouns: I have over **10 years of extensive experience** in application development using PowerBuilder and SQL.
I began my career at Intek Systems Pvt Ltd in 2014, where I worked with multiple versions of **PowerBuilder (PB 6.0, 9.0, and 12.6)** and **SQL (2000-2017)**, gaining a comprehensive understanding of the development lifecycle.
Since 2021, I have been with R Systems International as a Project Leader, overseeing a project for a US client focused on the Chartbase application, which streamlines patient flow.
In this role, I’ve had the opportunity to work with the latest versions of PowerBuilder, such as **version 2019 R2, R3, 2022 R2, and R3**, **MSSQL 2019**, **JIRA**, **BitBucket**, and **Visual Studio code**.
I successfully implemented new native features such as the **WebBrowser control**, **SMTPClient**, **PowerClient** for cloud application launching, **PDFdocument** , and custom **Themes** to enhance the user experience.
Additionally, I migrated the codebase from 2019 to 2022 and upgraded from 32-bit to 64-bit.
- ⚡ Fun fact: I am a Runner!
